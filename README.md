# VVdeC-rs

Rust bindings for [VVdeC](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/vvdec).

**Work in progress**: the bindings are not stable yet and may change at any time. Stabilization will begin once integration with some framework is working (e.g. GStreamer).

## Sub-projects:
- vvdec-sys: unsafe bindings generated by bindgen
- vvdec: the safe bindings on top of vvdec-sys
- vvdecli: CLI application using the safe bindings to simply decode VVC bitstream files into YUV4MPEG
- gst-plugin-vvdec: GStreamer video decoder element. Note: this will eventually be moved to [gst-plugins-rs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs) once it's mature enough to be reviewed.

## Installing the CLI

In order to build, either VVdeC needs to be installed and be found via pkg-config, or the environment variable `VVDEC_SYS_BUILD_DEP_FROM_SRC=1` needs to be set to build VVdeC from source. On macOS, VVdeC can be installed with `brew install vvdec`.

Then, the CLI app can be installed with `cargo install vvdecli`.

If you have FFmpeg installed, you can then test vvdecli and play VVC with
```
vvdecli -i ./tests/short.vvc | ffplay -
```
